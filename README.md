# BoterKaas-Eieren

Just a simple TicTacToe game, to test my knowledge in programming

Current features 
- Both players can give input to set their sign
- Check if the correct input was given, if not they will receive a message
- Check if a player has won if so that player will receive a message
- Check if there is a draw
- The ability to start a new game when the game is finished

Future features
- Keep score of the wins/lose/draws
- Add a GUI
- The ability to play over a LAN
- The ability to play this game on a website/phone app

I am still learning a lot and my knowledge is far from great while i am learning new stuff i will try to put that knowlegde in the future features.

Feel free to use it!
